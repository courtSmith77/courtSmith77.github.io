# BotROS

## Description
Description of the project

<!-- This project is my capstone for the Master of Science in Robotics (MSR) program at Northwestern University. In this project, I built on [MoveIt Deep Grasps](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/moveit_deep_grasps/moveit_deep_grasps_tutorial.html) and implemented autonomous grasping on a 7-DOF Kinova Jaco 2 arm (j2s7s300). The aim of this project is to facilitate activities of daily living (ADLs) and assist people who may not be able to perform daily tasks.  
This project was in collaboration with [argallab](https://www.argallab.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern, which focuses on rehabilitative and assistive robotics.  

Originally designed in simulation only and on a Franka Panda robot, some of my modifications and additions from MoveIt Deep Grasps include:
* Adaptation to the Kinova Jaco arm
* Translation to live hardware trajectory execution
* Live point cloud generation, segmentation, and filtering
* YOLOv8 object detection to provide semantic labeling and segmentation parameters for the object to grasp

This project largely uses ROS Noetic in C++ and Python.   -->
