# **About Me**

<br>

I am a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics with a tentative graduation date of December 2024. I recently graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a BS in Biomedical Engineering and a double minor in Robotics and Economics. I am interested in medical and wearable robotics, control system design, and robotic applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Outside of robotics, I love to be outdoors hiking or playing intramural sports. I also enjoying reading, watching reruns of Big Bang Theory, and baking!
